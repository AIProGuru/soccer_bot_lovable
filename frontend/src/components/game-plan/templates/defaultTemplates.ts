    tacticalSummary: "The low block is a defensive strategy where the team sits deep, close to its own penalty box, forming compact horizontal and vertical lines. The objective is to limit space behind the defense, block central channels, and force the opponent into low-percentage wide play. Attack through counter-attacks or isolated set-piece moments.",
